Requires Matlab 2015b-2018b

*Images were acqired with PrairieView 5.3, so indexing will 
need to be changed if other acquisiton software was used.* 

---OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS---

1. Lauch Matlab (2015b or later) and open the software.

2. Download corresponding "Example Image Data" folder.

3. In line 10 of the code, you should see a variable "start" under the
   label "Change Start Directory". Change the string to match the path
   where the example data set was saved.

4. Click the green "Run" button under the editor tab.

5. Let code run. Processing is dependent on the number of images and stacks 
   included, but expect the example data to take ~5-10 minutes for a standard, 
   office-grade desktop.

6. The expected output is two 16-bit .TIFF image stacks for the two acquisiton 
   wavelengths after the processing described in Supplementary Figure 1.
   Additionally, there will be two .mat files saved with the default save name 
   "ExclusionMatrix". This is a binary matrix that displays which images were 
   kept (1) and which were discarded (0) during the processing based on the number 
   of images in a stack, and the number of stacks in an average.

*Note: All example images were converted from native 16-bit into 8-bit to save
 on required memory and download time.
